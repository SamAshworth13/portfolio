This folder contains a project for the Mobile Applications Development unit from my final
year at university.

This project involved creating an app that would work similarly to Facebook. Meaning that
a user can create a profile, search for and view friends' profiles, add and remove friends,
post status updates and edit their profile info.

The creation of this app involved working with React Native, JavaScript, Node.js and HTML.
