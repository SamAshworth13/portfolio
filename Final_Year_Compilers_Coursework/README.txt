This folder contains coursework based on compilers from the
Programming Languages: Principles and Design unit from my final year at university.

For this coursework, I had to use Python to develop a compiler for a a simple imperative
language called Coffee. The details about this language are also stored here.

This compiler had to be able to detect semantic errors and generate assembly code for the
language.
