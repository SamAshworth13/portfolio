This folder contains some mini projects made during the Programming unit of my first year
at university.

The first project involves a set of bouncer objects that move around the screeen,
bouncing off the borders and each other.

The second folder contains two versions of a very simple game involving
dodging and shooting UFOs.

These mini projects were made in Processing with Java.
