This is the game created for my final year project, titled:
"Learning to Program Through Games".
The objective of this project was to create a game that could be used to teach programming
to someone with no prior experience.

The code can be opened and run in Processing.

To exit the game (exported version), either press the ESC key,
or click on the stop button in the bottom left corner.
