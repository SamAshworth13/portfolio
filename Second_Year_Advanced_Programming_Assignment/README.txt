This folder contains the assignment for my second year Advanced Programming unit.

The overall aim of this project was to create a program that would be able to access data
from a database and a scheduler that would, as efficiently as possible, organise flights by
automatically assigning aircraft, crew, passengers and routes to each other.

A marker program would then be used to calculate a
score for the scheduler (the marker program was provided with the assignment and was not
created by me). The lower the score the more efficient the scheduler was.

As part of the calculation of the grade for this project, my scheduler's score was compared to the scores of
other students' schedulers.

I received a mark of 91% for this project, meaning that my scheduler outperformed those of
most other students taking the unit at the same time.
