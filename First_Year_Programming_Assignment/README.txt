This folder contains a project made for the assignment of the Programming Unit
of my first year of university.

The objective was to create a game in Processing involving a player-controlled
character falling and having to dodge obstacles.

As an extra challenge, I also added a shooting mechanic, allowing enemies to
be destroyed for extra points.
